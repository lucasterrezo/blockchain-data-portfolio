# Blockchain Data Analytics Portfolio

Welcome! This repository is my personal space for exploring, analyzing, and visualizing on-chain data. It serves as a living portfolio of my journey into the world of blockchain analytics, showcasing my skills in SQL, Python, and data storytelling.

This is the home for my queries, notebooks, and dashboards as I dive deep into ecosystems like Solana, Ethereum, and various L2s.
